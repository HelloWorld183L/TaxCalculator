# TaxCalculator
Simple F# tax calculator made to learn more about functional programming

Note: Do not use this for actual income tax calculations as this tax calculator makes multiple assumptions (e.g. assumes a tax year of 2020/2021). Use a more developed tax calculator online or check with your tax office.
